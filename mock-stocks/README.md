# Mock Stocks

This application generates stock quotes, it was created with goal of having a stream of data that can be used
to study mainly kafka and elasticsearch.

# Running

To run the application you'll need a local accessible kafka. I prefer to run it in docker and 
[this is the one](https://github.com/mmaia/docker-compose-images/tree/master/kafka) I use during development.
